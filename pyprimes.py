"""Generate and test for small primes using a variety of algorithms
implemented in pure Python.

This module includes functions for generating prime numbers, primality
testing, and factorising numbers into prime factors. Prime numbers are
positive integers with no factors other than themselves and 1.


Generating prime numbers
========================

To generate an unending stream of prime numbers, use the ``primes()``
generator function:

    primes():
        Yield prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...


    >>> p = primes()
    >>> [next(p) for _ in range(10)]
    [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]


To efficiently generate pairs of (isprime(i), i) for integers i, use the
generator functions ``checked_ints()`` and ``checked_oddints()``:

    checked_ints()
        Yield pairs of (isprime(i), i) for i=0,1,2,3,4,5...

    checked_oddints()
        Yield pairs of (isprime(i), i) for odd i=1,3,5,7...


    >>> it = checked_ints()
    >>> [next(it) for _ in range(5)]
    [(False, 0), (False, 1), (True, 2), (True, 3), (False, 4)]


Other convenience functions wrapping ``primes()`` are:

    ------------------  ----------------------------------------------------
    Function            Description
    ------------------  ----------------------------------------------------
    nprimes(n)          Yield the first n primes, then stop.
    nth_prime(n)        Return the nth prime number.
    prime_count(x)      Return the number of primes less than or equal to x.
    primes_below(x)     Yield the primes less than or equal to x.
    primes_above(x)     Yield the primes strictly greater than x.
    primesum(n)         Return the sum of the first n primes.
    primesums()         Yield the partial sums of the prime numbers.
    ------------------  ----------------------------------------------------


Primality testing
=================

These functions test whether numbers are prime or not. Primality tests fall
into two categories: exact tests, and probabilistic tests.

Exact tests are guaranteed to give the correct result, but may be slow,
particularly for large arguments. Probabilistic tests do not guarantee
correctness, but may be much faster for large arguments.

To test whether an integer is prime, use the ``isprime`` function:

    isprime(n)
        Return True if n is prime, otherwise return False.


    >>> isprime(101)
    True
    >>> isprime(102)
    False


Exact primality tests are:

    isprime_naive(n)
        Naive and slow trial division test for n being prime.

    isprime_division(n)
        A less naive trial division test for n being prime.

    isprime_regex(n)
        Uses a regex to test if n is a prime number.

        .. NOTE:: ``isprime_regex`` should be considered a novelty
           rather than a serious test, as it is very slow.


Probabilistic tests do not guarantee correctness, but can be faster for
large arguments. There are two probabilistic tests:

    fermat(n [, base])
        Fermat primality test, returns True if n is a weak probable
        prime to the given base, otherwise False.

    miller_rabin(n [, base])
        Miller-Rabin primality test, returns True if n is a strong
        probable prime to the given base, otherwise False.


Both guarantee no false negatives: if either function returns False, the
number being tested is certainly composite. However, both are subject to false
positives: if they return True, the number is only possibly prime.


    >>> fermat(12400013)  # composite 23*443*1217
    False
    >>> miller_rabin(14008971)  # composite 3*947*4931
    False


Prime factorisation
===================

These functions return or yield the prime factors of an integer.

    factors(n)
        Return a list of the prime factors of n.

    factorise(n)
        Yield tuples (factor, count) for n.


The ``factors(n)`` function lists repeated factors:


    >>> factors(37*37*109)
    [37, 37, 109]


The ``factorise(n)`` generator yields a 2-tuple for each unique factor, giving
the factor itself and the number of times it is repeated:

    >>> list(factorise(37*37*109))
    [(37, 2), (109, 1)]


Alternative and toy prime number generators
===========================================

These functions are alternative methods of generating prime numbers. Unless
otherwise stated, they generate prime numbers lazily on demand. These are
supplied for educational purposes and are generally slower or less efficient
than the preferred ``primes()`` generator.

    --------------  --------------------------------------------------------
    Function        Description
    --------------  --------------------------------------------------------
    croft()         Yield prime numbers using the Croft Spiral sieve.
    erat(n)         Return primes up to n by the sieve of Eratosthenes.
    sieve()         Yield primes using the sieve of Eratosthenes.
    cookbook()      Yield primes using "Python Cookbook" algorithm.
    wheel()         Yield primes by wheel factorization.
    --------------  --------------------------------------------------------

    .. TIP:: In the current implementation, the fastest of these
       generators is aliased as ``primes()``.

        This algorithm is sometimes wrongly described as the Sieve of
        Eratosthenes, but it is not, it is a version of Euler's Sieve.

        Although simple, it is extremely slow and inefficient, with
        asymptotic behaviour of O(N**2/(log N)**2) which is even worse than
        trial division, and only marginally better than ``naive_primes1``.

    exact and the arguments ``trials`` and ``warn`` are ignored.

    Above this cut-off value, this function may be probabilistic with a small
    chance of wrongly reporting a composite (non-prime) number as prime. Such
    composite numbers wrongly reported as prime are "false positive" errors.

    The argument ``trials`` controls  the risk of a false positive error. The
    larger number of trials, the less the chance of an error (and the slower
    the function). With the default value of 25, you can expect roughly one
    such error every million trillion tests, which in practical terms is
    essentially "never".

    ``isprime`` cannot give a false negative error: if it reports a number is
    composite, it is certainly composite, but if it reports a number is prime,
    it may be only probably prime. If you pass a true value for argument
    ``warn``, then a warning will be raised if the result is probabilistic.

    ``base`` must be a positive integer between 1 and n-1 inclusive, or a
    tuple of such bases. By default, base=2.

    If ``fermat`` returns False, that is definite proof that n is composite:
    there are no false negatives. However, if it returns True, that is only

    We can conclude that 99 is definitely composite, and state that 7 is a

    pass a test, or even repeated tests:

    You can perform multiple tests with a single call by passing a tuple of
